Dear Doug, 

Just wanted to follow up on my column I sent you before Thanksgiving on the effect of the election on real estate prices in the DC area. In case you haven’t had a chance to read it, I pasted it below.

Since I haven’t heard from you, I assume the piece was not punchy or provocative enough? If you’re willing to give me a few pointers, I can try to rewrite it in a style or manner that would be more amenable for your readers. I’m open to suggestions. 

After this election, expect DC real estate prices to stay high.

What are the consequences of the recent federal election for the real estate market in the Washington D.C. Metro area? That question is indeed on the mind of investors, businesses, real estate professionals, and government employees. D.C. is a housing market like no other, as it is the home to the nation’s largest employer, the U.S. Federal Government.  According to most economic indicators, D.C. has had the highest average house price in the nation since June 2009, as the bubble popped everywhere but here.  Will this continue? 

The short answer is yes.  I predict real estate prices in the D.C. area to remain higher than other parts of the country. There are several different economic factors that contribute to this observation: the growing size of the federal workforce, the sluggish supply of new construction, low interest rates, and the asset purchase program of the Federal Reserve. Let’s take each of these in turn. 

First, consider the “real” side of the housing sector: supply and demand of homes. The real demand for housing is largely determined by population and demographics. As the largest employer in the area, the federal government has grown 21% over the last decade.  The growth of government, which has occurred over both the Bush and Obama administrations, ensures a steady influx of employees into this region, driving up demand for housing. Over this decade, some federal departments have grown faster than others (Defense grew 18%, Veterans Affairs grew 43%, Agriculture shrunk by 1%). But averaging across all groups, the government has grown almost fifty percent faster than the U.S. population over this same time horizon. 

The real supply for housing is measured by housing starts. The number of new housing units constructed has collapsed after the housing bubble burst, and it has not yet picked up. Housing starts have been flat over the last six months. Given the limited available space in the D.C. area, the continuing sluggish performance of the U.S. economy, and the time it takes to build, I don’t believe construction will markedly rise in the foreseeable future. Thus, we are living in a world of increasing demand and fixed supply, which can only mean one thing: rising prices. 

The Federal Reserve plays a substantial role in the price of housing. It determines the size of the money supply by setting the target federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to one another. This rate is highly correlated with LIBOR, the rate that most U.S. mortgages follow. The Fed has set nominal interest rates to zero (and the real interest rate is negative) for some time, and has made verbal commitments to keep rates low for the foreseeable future. It is impossible to know for sure, but the rhetoric of our central bankers point to maintaining low interest rates as long as possible. Low interest rates stimulate demand for housing since they make mortgages (and in fact, all kinds of debt) more affordable. On top of this, the Fed also supports the “financial” side of the housing sector. It has committed to purchase up to $40 billion per month of mortgage backed securities (MBS) from the private sector. This directly stimulates the demand for mortgage backed securities, which indirectly encourages the demand for housing.  Both policies of the Fed stimulate housing demand.

The bottom line is that this new administration and its accompanying financial regulators will continue to support the housing market, both nationally and locally. All of these efforts will cause both commercial and residential real estate prices to remain strong, especially relative to the rest of the nation.

Subject: Lunch with Yuval

Chris,

Just had launch with Yuval of National Affairs. It was great to meet him. Thanks again for connecting us. I owe you a lot for sharing your network with me.

He’s doing great, and we talked about the need for long form journalism. They have great pieces and I am a subscriber. 

Quick question – when I meet with him for lunch, am I supposed to pay? I didn’t because I thought it would look like a conflict of interest since he’s asked me to write for his journal in the past. I didn’t want him to think that I was trying to buy a spot in the journal.

Anyway, hope the new gig is going well.

Korok

PS – Kathy and I had to reschedule. We will be meeting up at the end of the month.

Subject: Articles from National Affairs

Yuval,

It was great meeting you for lunch. Glad we got a chance to sit down and talk. I enjoyed our discussion and share your taste for a more generalist intellectual discourse.

I would like to include five essays from National Affairs printed into a booklet that I’d like to distribute to my students. The students can purchase this booklet from the bookstore. A single booklet would be most convenient, but five separate booklets of each essay would also be fine. I feel like if you include all essays in a single booklet, they are less likely to complain that these are available online for free. Here are the five essays: 

1. How to Grade Teachers by Marcus Winters
2. Real Medicare Reform by Daniel Kessler
3. A Federal Education Agenda by Frederick Hess and Andrew Kelly
4. Devaluing the Think Tank by Tevi Troy
5. How to Regulate Bank Capital by Charles Calomiris 

I’ve enjoyed reading all of these and would love to share these with my students. I can include them on the Spring 2013 syllabus. If we can get the books into the GW bookstore by the start of class of January 14th, that would be ideal. If not, the booklets can arrive late and we can start reading them mid-semester.

Justin,

If the Yahoo data on stock searches is less than 10 GB, we should we able to share it through Dropbox. Do you want to try uploading it? I have about 15 GB of free space so I can handle it on my side. What do you think?
